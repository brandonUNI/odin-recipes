    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        Pupusas are traditional Salvadoran stuffed corn tortillas made from masa harina (corn flour). 
        They are typically filled with a variety of ingredients such as cheese, refried beans, and seasoned pork (chicharrón).
        The dough is formed into a ball, flattened, filled, and then cooked on a griddle until golden brown.
        Pupusas are often served with a tangy cabbage slaw called curtido and a tomato-based salsa.
        They are a popular comfort food in El Salvador and enjoyed by many around the world.

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>In a large bowl, mix masa harina, water, and salt to form a dough. Knead until smooth and pliable.</li>
        <li>Divide the dough into small balls, about the size of a golf ball.</li>
        <li>Flatten each ball into a disc using your hands.</li>
        <li>Add a spoonful of filling (cheese, refried beans, or seasoned pork) to the center of each disc.</li>
        <li>Carefully fold the edges of the disc around the filling to enclose it, then flatten it again to form a thick, filled tortilla.</li>
        <li>Heat a griddle or skillet over medium-high heat and lightly oil it.</li>
        <li>Cook the pupusas on the hot griddle for about 3-4 minutes on each side, until golden brown and crispy.</li>
        <li>Prepare the curtido by mixing shredded cabbage, grated carrots, and thinly sliced onion with vinegar, salt, and water. Let it marinate for at least 30 minutes.</li>
        <li>Make the salsa by blending tomatoes, garlic, cilantro, salt, and pepper until smooth. Cook the salsa in a pan over medium heat for 10 minutes to thicken.</li>
        <li>Serve the hot pupusas with curtido and salsa on the side.</li>
