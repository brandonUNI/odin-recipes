    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        Smash burgers are a type of hamburger where the ground beef patty is smashed flat against a hot griddle or skillet, creating a thin, crispy exterior with a juicy interior. 
        The smashing process allows for maximum browning and caramelization, resulting in a flavorful crust. Smash burgers are typically served with classic toppings like cheese, 
        pickles, onions, and special sauce on a soft bun. They are known for their simple preparation and delicious, crispy texture.

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Ground beef (preferably 80/20 blend)</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper</li>
        <li>Soft hamburger buns</li>
        <li>American cheese slices</li>
        <li>Pickles</li>
        <li>Onions (thinly sliced)</li>
        <li>Special sauce or mayonnaise</li>
        <li>Butter (for toasting buns)</li>
        <li>Vegetable oil (for cooking)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat and lightly oil the grate. Set a cast iron flat-top griddle or large cast iron skillet onto the grill and preheat until smoking.</li>
        <li>Spread butter on the inside of the buns and toast on the flat-top until lightly browned. Set aside.</li>
        <li>Form meat into 8 loosely-packed balls, 2 ounces each. Do not pack the meat tightly, as this will prevent it from smashing properly. Place each ball on the hot flat-top, cover with a piece of parchment (to prevent sticking to the spatula; re-use each parchment square on a second patty) and immediately smash down to a 1/4 inch thickness using 2 stiff, sturdy spatulas that are criss-crossed to get proper leverage as you press down. You may also use the bottom of small skillet. Sprinkle the meat with salt.</li>
        <li>Grill for about 45 seconds, until the edges are dark brown and the centers are a light pink color. Using a bench scraper or firm spatula, gently scrape up the patties, flip over and immediately cover 4 of them with cheese. Grill an additional 15 to 20 seconds; stack the plain patties over the cheese-covered patties so you have 4 stacks.</li>
        <li>Move each stack to a bun and serve with your favorite toppings.</li>
    </ol>
